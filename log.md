# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Moved old CSS code to SASS, fixed styling on Past Issues page

**Thoughts:** Debugging CSS/SASS is a nightmare. I need to spend more time on better
structuring file trees for SCSS and CSS files. I am definitely getting more comfortable
using the Chrome developer tools.
