# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Moved old CSS code to SASS, fixed styling on Past Issues page

**Thoughts:** Debugging CSS/SASS is a nightmare. I need to spend more time on better
structuring file trees for SCSS and CSS files. I am definitely getting more comfortable
using the Chrome developer tools.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**: Worked on Flask as the back-end of portfolio website.

**Thoughts:**: I've worked with a couple javascript frameworks last year. Flask
is easy enough to read and write that I feel as though I'm learning a lot about
the internet and web app development just by working with it.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**: Resized Twitter widget on the Anemoi site and made the whole
site more mobile friendly. Also continued to work on Flask app.

**Thoughts:**: Not sure if I want to rework the front page to add margins to the
divs.
